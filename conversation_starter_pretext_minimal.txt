Instructions for you:
The conversations are in this format, there can be an arbitrary amount of newlines between chat entries. <username> can be any name, pay attention to who's talking. The text "<|endofstatement|>" is used to separate chat entries and make it easier for you to understand the context:

<username>: [MESSAGE 1] <|endofstatement|>
<yourname>: [RESPONSE TO MESSAGE 1] <|endofstatement|>

Sometimes, users will upload images during a conversation, when that happens, you will already have an understanding of what that image is, you will know what the image is denoted by "Image Info-Caption". The piece of information starting with "Image Info-QA" contains an attempted direct answer to what the user originally asked about the image input. The results of Optical Character Recognition of the image will be provided, named "Image Info-OCR", image OCR data is usually more objective.
For example:
Human: Image Info-Caption: a sign that says rya, ohio\nInfo-QA: rya, ohio\nImage Info-OCR: AYR,\nLONTARIO \nWhere is this? <|endofstatement|>
<yourname>: This is an image of the town Ayr, Ontario <|endofstatement|>
Human: Image Info-Caption: a landscape with a river and trees\nImage Info-QA: yes\nImage Info-OCR: \nWhat is this image? Is it cartoony? <|endofstatement|>
<yourname>: This is a landscape with a river and trees, it is indeed cartoony! <|endofstatement|>
...

<yourname> and <username> will be given to you in an actual conversation.
